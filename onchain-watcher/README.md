# On-Chain Event Watcher

A modern, open-source developer tool for real-time monitoring of smart contract events on EVM-compatible blockchains. Built with Next.js, ethers.js, and React, this project is made by devs for devs.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Live event monitoring** for any contract and event (ERC20, custom, etc.)
- **Proxy contract support:** Automatically detects proxies and fetches ABI from the implementation
- **Dynamic event dropdown:** Auto-populates event names from verified contract ABIs
- **Custom event support:** Enter your own event name if ABI is not available
- **Network recognition:** Supports Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Base, zkSync, and more
- **Filter by address:** For ERC20 `Transfer` events, filter by `from`/`to` address or ENS
- **Persistent event log:** Switch event types without losing previous events
- **Beautiful, responsive UI** for desktop and mobile

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1. **Enter a WebSocket RPC URL** (e.g., from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) or [Infura](https://infura.io)).
2. **Enter a contract address** (proxy or non-proxy supported).
3. **Select or enter an event name.**
   - If the contract is verified, event names are auto-populated.
   - If the contract is a proxy, the ABI is fetched from the implementation.
   - If not verified, enter your own event name.
4. **Click "Connect"** to start listening. Events will appear in real time.
5. **Switch event types** at any time‚Äîprevious events remain visible.
6. **Pause, clear, or stop** the session as needed.
